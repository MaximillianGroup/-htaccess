# MaxX OnGuard&trade; Security Policy

MaximillianGroup takes the security of our plugins and the trust of our users very seriously.  This document outlines the security policies for the Template plugin.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you believe you have found a security issue in Stellarsizer, please report it to us directly at [maximilliangroup@gmail.com](mailto:maximilliangroup@gmail.com).

**Please do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities.** Publicly disclosing a potential vulnerability before it has been addressed could put users at risk.

**When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much of the following information as possible:**

* **Affected plugin version:**  (e.g., MaxX OnGuard 0.5.0)
* **A detailed description of the vulnerability:**  Explain how the vulnerability works and its potential impact.
* **Steps to reproduce the vulnerability:**  Provide clear steps to help us verify the issue.
* **Proof of concept (PoC):**  If applicable, provide a PoC demonstrating the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Handling Process

1. **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 3 business days.
2. **Investigation:** Our security team will investigate the reported issue to determine its validity and severity.
3. **Patching:**  If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will develop and test a patch to address the issue.
4. **Release:**  We will release the security patch in a timely manner, along with a security advisory that includes:
    * A description of the vulnerability
    * Affected versions of Max OnGuard
    * Remediation steps (usually updating to the patched version)
5. **Public Disclosure:**  We may publicly disclose the vulnerability after a reasonable time period has passed to allow users to update.

## Supported Versions

We are committed to providing security support for the following Template versions:

* **Currently Supported:** 0.5.0 and later (up to the latest release)

Once MaxX OnGuard reaches version 1.0.0 (first public release), we will clearly define an end-of-life policy for older versions.

## Security Practices

We follow secure coding practices during MaxX OnGuard's development, including:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Protecting against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.
* **Secure Authentication and Authorization:**  Ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive plugin functionality.
* **Dependency Management:**  Keeping plugin dependencies up-to-date to address known security issues.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conducting periodic security reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We kindly request that you follow these guidelines when reporting vulnerabilities:

* Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it.
* Do not disclose the vulnerability to any third party until we have had a reasonable opportunity to address it.
* Respect our vulnerability handling process and timelines.

We appreciate your cooperation in helping us keep MaxX OnGuard and its users secure.
