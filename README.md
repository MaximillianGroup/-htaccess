- Apache .htaccess + .conf files to secure your WordPress Site
- With 8G Bot Protection by Perishable Press
- *An .htaccess file that works!*

## Security Settings and Optimization Guide

This guide explains the combined use of `.htaccess` and `.conf` files to secure and optimize your WordPress website. It covers core security settings, performance optimization, bot protection, and integration with WordPress.

## Why Use Both .htaccess and .conf?

*This configuration provides a robust foundation for a secure and optimized WordPress site.* By using both files effectively, you create a comprehensive security and optimization strategy for your website. 

- **.htaccess:**  Provides a per-directory configuration for Apache, allowing fine-grained control over specific folders or files. It's ideal for implementing directory-specific security measures, rewrite rules, and custom configurations.
- **.conf:**  Provides a broader configuration for Apache, defining virtual hosts, server settings, and global configurations. It's essential for setting up SSL certificates, redirecting traffic, and managing server-wide security policies.

### It protects and improves performance with:

- **Core Security Settings:** Disables server signature, limits file upload size, protects against DOS attacks, and more.
- **Security Headers Enforce Best Practice:** Enforces Content Security Policy, CORS, and other security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Optimization:** Enables GZIP compression, sets custom MIME types, and optimizes caching.
- **8G Firewall Bot Protections:** Implements a robust firewall to block suspicious requests and user agents.
- **WordPress Integration:** Includes specific rules for WordPress installations, including directory browsing protection.
- **Custom Error Handling:** Redirects invalid requests to a custom error page.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Create a new file named `.htaccess` in your website's root directory.**
2. **Copy and paste the entire code from this file into the new `.htaccess` file.**
3. **Save the file.**

## Recommendations and Adjustments

This `.htaccess` file is a comprehensive starting point for securing and optimizing your website. You may need to adjust certain sections based on your specific needs and preferences.

**Core Security Settings:**

- **`LimitRequestBody`:**  Adjust the file upload size (in bytes) to suit your specific needs.
- **`AddHandler`:**  Modify this directive to allow or disallow script execution for other file types.
- **`RewriteBase`:** Adjust this directive if your website is not located at the root directory.

**Security Headers:**

- **`Content-Security-Policy`:**  Carefully configure this directive to allow only the resources that your website needs.
- **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`:**  Adjust the value to define allowed origins for your API or web applications.
- **`Strict-Transport-Security`:** Consider the value of `max-age` to balance security and browser caching.

**8G Firewall:**

- **`RewriteCond`:**  Customize the firewall rules to block specific user agents, remote hosts, or referrers that might be posing a security risk.

**WordPress Integration:**

- **`RewriteRule`:**  Adjust the rules to match the specific paths used in your WordPress installation.

**Custom Error Handling:**

- **`RewriteRule`:**  Modify the path to `error.html` to match the location of your custom error page.

**MIME Types and Charset Settings:**

- **`AddType`:**  Add or remove MIME types to match the file types used on your website.
- **`AddCharset`:** Adjust this directive to specify the desired character encoding for specific file types.

**Performance Optimization:**

- **`ExpiresByType`:**  Customize the cache expiration times to suit your specific needs.
- **`Header append Cache-Control`:**  Consider adding other cache control directives, such as `no-cache` or `must-revalidate`, to manage browser caching behavior.

## Overview of domain.conf File

This configuration file is designed to provide a secure and optimized Apache setup for a WordPress site.  It leverages SSL using Let's Encrypt certificates for secure HTTPS traffic and includes various security measures to protect the site from common vulnerabilities and attacks. 

## Modules and Listeners

This section loads essential Apache modules and configures the server to listen on both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).

```apache
# Load necessary modules
LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so
LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so

# Listen on HTTP and HTTPS ports
Listen 80
Listen 443
```

## HTTP to HTTPS Redirection
This section redirects all incoming HTTP traffic (port 80) to HTTPS, enforcing a secure connection for all users.

```apache
# HTTP VirtualHost to redirect all traffic to HTTPS
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName sparxstar.com
    ServerAlias www.sparxstar.com

    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
</VirtualHost>
```
## HTTPS VirtualHost Configuration
This is the primary VirtualHost, handling all HTTPS traffic on port 443. It includes the main website settings, SSL certificates, and security configurations.

```apache
# HTTPS VirtualHost with SSL configuration
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName sparxstar.com
    ServerAlias www.sparxstar.com

    # Document root for the site
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    # Enable SSL engine
    SSLEngine on
```
## SSL Certificates
This configuration uses Let's Encrypt certificates for secure HTTPS communication.

```apache
# SSL Certificates from Let's Encrypt
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/sparxstar.com/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/sparxstar.com/privkey.pem
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/sparxstar.com/chain.pem
```
## SSL Security
This section enforces strong encryption, preferred cipher order, and enables OCSP stapling for enhanced SSL security.

```apache
# Strong Ciphers and Enforcing Cipher Order
    SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5
    SSLHonorCipherOrder on

    # Enable OCSP Stapling
    SSLUseStapling On
    SSLStaplingCache "shmcb:/var/log/apache2/ssl_stapling(32768)"
```
## WordPress Directory Permissions
This section defines the permissions for the WordPress directory (/var/www/html/wp-content) to enable .htaccess overrides and restrict access to certain files.

```apache
# Directory settings for WordPress root directory
    <Directory /var/www/html>
        # Allows .htaccess to handle Mod Rewrite and other rules
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # Directory-level restrictions
    <Directory /var/www/html/wp-content>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
```
#3 Additional Security Settings
This section restricts script execution in the wp-content/uploads directory to prevent potential exploits.

```apache
# Restrict PHP, JS, and other script execution in uploads directory
    <Directory /var/www/html/wp-content/uploads>
        <FilesMatch "\.(php|js|cgi|as|pl|py|rb|sh)$">
           Require all denied
        </FilesMatch>
    </Directory>
```
## Optional Client Certificate Authentication
Client certificate authentication can be enabled to add an additional security layer, ensuring only clients with valid certificates can access the site.

```
# Optional: Client Certificate Authentication
    # Uncomment the lines below to require a client certificate
    # SSLVerifyClient require
    # SSLVerifyDepth 1
    # SSLCACertificateFile /path/to/ca.crt
```
##  Logging
This section configures Apache to log SSL-related events and access logs, which are crucial for debugging and security monitoring.

```apache
# Logging for SSL
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
## Deployment Notes
After configuring the Apache server, restart Apache to apply the changes:

```apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
## Recommendations
- **CORS:** In production, configure Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin to specific origins instead of using *.
- **wp-admin Authentication:** Uncomment and configure the wp-admin directory block if you want to use Basic Authentication for the WordPress admin area.
- **Test Thoroughly:** After making changes, test your website thoroughly to ensure everything is working as expected and no mixed content issues have been introduced.

## **Important Notes:**

- **Use Code with Caution:** The provided `.htaccess` file includes powerful directives that can have a significant impact on your website's functionality. Carefully review the code and only make changes that you fully understand.
- **Test Thoroughly:**  Test your website after making any changes to `.htaccess` to ensure that everything is working correctly.
- **Backup Your Files:** Always create a backup of your website's files before making any changes to `.htaccess`.
